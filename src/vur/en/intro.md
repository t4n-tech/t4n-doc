## What is VUR?

**VUR (Void User Repository)** is a community repository for Void Linux-based systems and its derivatives, including T4n OS, that allows users to share and manage metadata-based package templates.

Conceptually, VUR is similar to the AUR (Arch User Repository)** on Arch Linux.

## Purpose of VUR

VUR was created to:

* Provide packages not yet available in the official Void repository
* Encourage community contributions
* Facilitate template distribution
* Expand the T4n OS & Void ecosystem

In other words, VUR is a bridge between the community and the system.

## How VUR Works

Unlike a regular binary repository, VUR typically contains:

* Templates
* Build script files
* Package metadata

So, VUR is not a binary repo for direct installation, but rather a template repo for local builds.

## VUR vs. the Official Void Repository

| Official Repository              | VUR                            |
| ---------------------------------| ------------------------------ |
| Maintained by the Void team      | Maintained by the community    |
| Packages are pre-built (binary)  | Build templates (source-based) |
| Stable & verified                | Experimental                   |
| Limited to official maintainers  | Open to contributions          |

## Why is VUR Important for T4n OS?

Because VUR:

* Makes T4n OS more flexible
* Reduces dependence on the official repository
* Establishes its own identity and ecosystem
* Provides space for innovation

VUR is the foundation of the community.

## In short

> VUR is an `xbps-src`-based community repository for Void Linux and T4n OS, allowing users to build and share packages independently.
